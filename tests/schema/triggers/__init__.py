# Note, the triggers are only python 2.x compatible. It's assumed,
# at least for now, that in-database logic (i.e. triggers) are only
# run within a python2 environment. This product is to be setup in a
# production environment running within the database under python2 and
# optionally running within application code under either python2 or python3.
